**minnars**

An experiment of a stateless multistep declarative reasoning implementation of NARS,
working heavily inspired by Synthesizer in hyperon-pln.
This sub-project only borrows the logic from metta-nars.
For a standalone metta file with a useful selected subset of inference rules,
see https://gist.github.com/patham9/c2a17616fd8269c41ac1596149d0e656
